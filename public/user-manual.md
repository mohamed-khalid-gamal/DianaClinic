## 12. Services

### Overview

Define the treatments and procedures your clinic offers with flexible pricing models.

### Service Catalog

Services are organized by category with:
- Service name
- Duration (minutes)
- Pricing display
- Active/Inactive status

### Pricing Models (Detailed)

The system supports 4 distinct pricing models. Each service can have ONE primary pricing model.

#### 1. Fixed Price (`fixed`)

**Use Case**: Standard treatments with consistent pricing regardless of time or pulses used.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Base Price | The flat fee charged per session |

**Examples**:
- Consultation: EGP 500/session
- Facial Treatment: EGP 800/session
- Chemical Peel: EGP 1,200/session

**Best For**: Consultations, facials, standard procedures with predictable duration.

**Booking Behavior**: Patient pays the fixed price. One session = one credit if using package credits.

---

#### 2. Pulse-Based Pricing (`pulse`)

**Use Case**: Laser treatments where the number of pulses varies based on treatment area/patient.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Base Price | Minimum fee per session (covers setup, gel, etc.) |
| Price Per Pulse | Additional cost per laser pulse fired |

**Example**:
- Laser Hair Removal
  - Base: EGP 200
  - Per Pulse: EGP 5
  - Total for 500 pulses: EGP 200 + (500 × 5) = EGP 2,700

**Credit System**: 
- Credits are stored as **pulse units**, not sessions
- Package "5,000 Pulses" means patient has 5,000 pulse credits
- Each treatment deducts actual pulses used from balance

**Session End Workflow**:
1. Doctor logs device usage (counter start → counter end)
2. System calculates pulses used
3. If patient has pulse credits: Deduct from wallet
4. If pulses exceed credits: Extra pulses charged at per-pulse rate

---

#### 3. Area-Based Pricing (`area`)

**Use Case**: Treatments where price varies by body area (e.g., Botox, Laser zones).

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Areas | List of area names with individual prices |

**Example - Laser Hair Removal**:
| Area | Price |
|------|-------|
| Upper Lip | EGP 300 |
| Underarms | EGP 500 |
| Bikini | EGP 700 |
| Full Legs | EGP 2,000 |
| Full Body | EGP 5,000 |

**Example - Botox**:
| Area | Price |
|------|-------|
| Forehead | EGP 1,500 |
| Crow's Feet | EGP 1,200 |
| Frown Lines | EGP 1,000 |
| Full Upper Face | EGP 3,500 |

**Booking Behavior**:
- During booking, user selects the specific area
- Price adjusts based on selected area
- If using credits: 1 session credit = 1 area treatment

---

#### 4. Time-Based Pricing (`time`)

**Use Case**: Services charged by duration (extended consultations, therapy sessions).

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Base Price | Minimum charge (optional) |
| Price Per Minute | Rate per minute of session |

**Example**:
- Extended Consultation
  - Base: EGP 0
  - Per Minute: EGP 10
  - 45-minute session: EGP 450

**Session End Workflow**:
1. System tracks session duration (start time → end time)
2. Calculates total minutes
3. Applies time-based pricing formula

---

### Service Configuration Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Required Devices** | Specify which devices are needed (e.g., "Candela Laser") |
| **Consumables** | Default items used (e.g., "Cooling Gel - 50ml") |
| **Required Room Types** | Only allow booking in specific room types |
| **Allowed Doctors** | Restrict service to certified doctors only |

### Tips & Tricks for Services

1. **Multiple Pricing Areas**: Add all possible areas upfront—patients see a dropdown during booking.

2. **Device Tracking**: Link services to devices for automatic pulse counting.

3. **Consumables**: Pre-define consumables to auto-suggest during session end.

4. **Doctor Restrictions**: Use for specialized procedures requiring certification.

5. **Duration Accuracy**: Set realistic durations—system uses this for slot availability.

---

## 13. Offers and Packages (Full Comprehensive Guide)

### 13.1 Overview
The Offers Engine is a sophisticated rule-based system that allows the clinic to manage promotions, loyalty programs, and bundled packages. It is designed to be highly flexible, allowing combinations of various types, complex triggers (conditions), and diverse rewards (benefits).

### 13.2 Offer Types & Varieties
The system categorizes offers into six primary types, though they can be further customized:

*   **Percentage Discount (`percentage`)**: Reduces the cost of services by a set percentage (e.g., 15% off).
*   **Fixed Amount Discount (`fixed_amount`)**: Subtracts a flat EGP value from the total (e.g., EGP 200 off).
*   **Bundle Pricing (`bundle`)**: Offers a specific set of services at a pre-defined fixed price when booked together.
*   **Credit Package (`package`)**: The most popular variety, used to sell "Session" or "Pulse" credits in bulk (e.g., a "10-Session Laser Package").
*   **Buy X Get Y (`buyXgetY`)**: Triggers a reward after a specific quantity is purchased (e.g., "Buy 5, Get 1 Free").
*   **Conditional Rules (`conditional`)**: Purely rule-based offers that apply dynamic discounts based on complex patient or cart attributes.

### 13.3 Comprehensive Offer Conditions
Conditions are the "triggers" that determine if an offer is applicable. You can combine multiple conditions using nested logic.

#### Logical Groups
*   **AND Group**: All conditions within this group must be true.
*   **OR Group**: At least one condition within this group must be true.

#### Trigger Categories
| Condition Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Service Requirements** | Must include specific services or items from chosen categories in the cart. |
| **Minimum Spend** | The total booking amount must meet or exceed a specific threshold. |
| **New Patient** | Automatically identifies patients with no prior history or those registered recently. |
| **Patient Tags** | Targets groups based on assigned tags (VIP, Employee, Referral, etc.). |
| **Date Range** | Restricts the offer to a specific start and end date (e.g., "Ramadan Special"). |
| **Time of Day** | Happy hour style pricing valid only during specific hours (e.g., 9:00 AM - 1:00 PM). |
| **Days of Week** | Valid only on specific days (e.g., "Weekend Glow - Sat/Sun only"). |
| **Specific Patients** | Direct targeting of individual patients for private or compensatory offers. |
| **Visit Count** | Loyalty-based trigger (e.g., "Applies on your 10th visit"). |
| **Patient Attributes** | Based on patient metadata like age, gender, or medical history. |

### 13.4 Offer Benefits (The Rewards)
When conditions are met, the system applies one of these benefits:

*   **Percent Off**: A percentage reduction applied to the applicable services.
*   **Fixed Amount Off**: A flat discount subtracted from the subtotal.
*   **Fixed Total Price**: Forces the total for the selected services to a specific price (common for bundles).
*   **Grant Package Credits**: Instead of an immediate discount, it adds "Credits" to the patient's wallet. These can be **Session Units** (for fixed/area pricing) or **Pulse Units** (for laser/pulse pricing).
*   **Free Session**: Grants one or more free treatments when the "Buy X" threshold is reached.

### 13.5 Advanced Management Features

#### 13.5.1 Priority & Stacking
*   **Priority (1-100)**: Determines the application sequence. Higher priority offers are evaluated first.
*   **Exclusivity**: If an offer is marked as **Exclusive**, it cannot be combined with any other offers. If the system detects multiple offers, it will prioritize the exclusive one or allow the user to choose.

#### 13.5.2 Usage Limits
*   **Per Patient Limit**: Restricts how many times an individual patient can use an offer (e.g., "One-time welcome discount").
*   **Total Usage Limit**: A global cap on how many times the offer can be redeemed clinic-wide (e.g., "First 50 customers only").

#### 13.5.3 Validity Controls
*   **Active/Inactive Toggle**: Instantly enable or disable an offer without deleting it.
*   **Validation**: The system automatically checks validity upon booking and billing to ensure expired offers are not used.

### 13.6 The Offer Creation Wizard (3 Steps)
The creation process is split into three logical steps. Each step guides you through defining the identity, the triggers, and the rewards. For a granular description of every input field, see **Section 13.8**.

1.  **Step 1: General Info**: Set name, description, priority, and exclusivity.
2.  **Step 2: Conditions**: Build the logic tree using the "Add Condition" and "Add Group" tools.

### 13.8 The Complete Field & Input Reference

This section provides a granular, field-by-field explanation of every input encountered in the 3-step creation wizard.

This step establishes the metadata and high-level behavioral rules.

|-------|----------------------|--------------------|
| **Offer Name** | The name displayed in the offers grid and on invoices. | Use something descriptive like "New Patient 15% Off". |
| **Description** | Detailed explanation of the offer's purpose or internal notes. | Not visible on standard invoices, but helps staff understand the rule. |

| **Valid Until** | The date the promotion ends. | Inclusive. At 00:00:00 after this date, the offer expires. |

| **Exclusive Flag** | Determines if this offer can "stack" with others. | **Exclusive** = No other discounts allowed. **Non-exclusive** = Allows stacking with other non-exclusive rules. |
| **Patient Limit** | Max redemptions *per individual patient*. | Controls for "One-time" introductory offers. |
| **Total Limit** | Max redemptions *clinic-wide* across all patients. | Essential for limited-time "First 50 people" campaigns. |
